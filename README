This is a Java solution to the stable marriage problem.
The problem is when given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all members of the opposite sex 
with a unique number between 1 and n in order of preference, marry the men and women together such that there 
are no two people of opposite sex who would both rather have each other than their current partners. 
If there are no such people, all the marriages are "stable".
